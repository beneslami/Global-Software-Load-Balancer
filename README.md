Global Software Load Balancer
This is a final presentaton of my internship project at ITRI, Taiwan. 
Throughout this project, I was responsible for developing a Global Software Load Balancer for OpenStack environment.
The code is proprietary so I am not allowd to share it here. But you can find the general information of this project in the presentation.

cheers.
